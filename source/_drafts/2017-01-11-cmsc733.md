# what does `im2double(I)` do?

On `uint8`, `im2double(I)` performs `[pixel_val/255]` on every pixel. The output of `im2double()` result in value range from `[0,1]`.

# why perform `im2double(I)` on gary-scale image?

- unsigned int cannot represent negative number  
- standardzie image w/ different range of values (uint8, uint 16, etc)  

# how does `rgb2gray` works? 

General formula: 

`Gray = 0.299×Red + 0.587×Green + 0.114×Blue`
