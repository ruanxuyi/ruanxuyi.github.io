## description  
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function `twoSum` should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are NOT zero-based.

**Example**  
numbers=`[2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target=9`

return `[1, 2]`

## code  

```java
public class Solution {
    /*
     * @param numbers : An array of Integer
     * @param target : target = numbers[index1] + numbers[index2]
     * @return : [index1 + 1, index2 + 1] (index1 < index2)
     */
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        // write your code here
        if (numbers.length == 0 || numbers == null) {
            return new int[0];
        }
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hash = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            if (hash.get(numbers[i]) != null) {
                return (new int[]{hash.get(numbers[i])+1, i+1});
            } else {
                hash.put(target-numbers[i], i);
            }
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}

## algorithm correctness 

HashtMap has an average constant time look up. We can utilize that in this question. 

Loop through the entire array through index `i`, store `<Key, value>` pair of `<target-array[i], index i >` into the hashMap. As we are walking through the array, if we find `target-array[i]` in a later time, we return the [`curr index i`, `hashMap[array[i]]`].  

The space complexity for this question is $O(n)$ - which is size of the array for hashmap stores <key, value> pairs.  

The time complexity is $O(n)$ to traverse the entire array with `n` elements.
