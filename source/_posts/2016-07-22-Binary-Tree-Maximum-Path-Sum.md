# Description: 

Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

The path may start and end at any node in the tree.

**Example**  
Given the below binary tree:

```java
  1
 / \
2   3
```

return 6.

# Thought Process:

This problem is particular interesting, since the max path is not limited with any start and end point.  

- Break problem into smaller pieces (fundmental parts).    
- The fundmental part for this problem build with, `root`, `root.left`, and `root.right`  

```java
// fundmental unit
		root
		/	\
root.left	 root.right
(leftSum)   (rightSum)

Note: leftSum and rightSum from previous recursive
```

- Second step is try to figure out how does the fundemental part contribute/affect the whole tree structure.  

Within the fundemental unit, the max sum for that unit could be one of the following(max of them):  
- `root.val`  
- `root.val + leftSum`  
- `root.val + rightSum`

We returned the max of the three above to the previous recursive call.  

One last step: Since the max path could start and end in **any** nodes of the tree. It could be the case that max path connect both paths with the same LCA(lowest common ancester). Therefore, we should also record `root.val + rightSum + leftSum` seperately.
