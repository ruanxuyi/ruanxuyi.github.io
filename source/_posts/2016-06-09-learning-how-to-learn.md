# Summary
This note intends to record all the interesting points learned from the online course <Learning how to learn> by Coursera. It was a very high rated class and I learned a lot about how to better learn and master material. I hope you will find these notes are also helpful for you own study.  

# Week1 due on 06/12/2016


## Set up goal list before sleep

- the evening before sleep, write down few goals on the left portion of a piece of paper, as **Day** task.  
- In the morning, look over your **Day **list, and break down each individual goal into a little mini-list of three or four mini-tasks under the **Now List**.  
- cross off mini-task that you have accomplished, together with the corresponding goals under **Day List**.  
- Even you usually don't finish all the goals from the **Day list** (no worry, that happens to everyone:) ), you still make a lot more progress this way.

## 10 Rules of Good Studying

**1. Use recall**:   
- After you read a page, look away and recall the main ideas.   
- *Selective in highlighting*. Never highlight anything that was not in your mind during the first recalled.   
- Try to recall the main idea while you are walking to the classroom. Recall it when you are in a *different location* from where you leared it. 

**2. Test yourself**:  
- On everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend.  

**3. Chunk your problems**:  
- After you solve a problem, rehearse it.  

**4. Space your repetition**:  
-  Spread out your learning in any subject a little every day  
-  Your brain is like a muscle—it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time.  


**5. Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice**:   
- Never practice too long at any one session using only one problem-solving technique   
- if stuck on some problem, or stuck on certain stage of your learning? try **different method, new approach**, might be it was not that hard with a different angle of view.  
-  **go over** your errors after every assignment and test, **understand** why you made them, and then **rework** your solutions.   
- Another way to do this is to randomly flip through your book, pick out a problem, and see whether you can solve it cold.   
- **Hand-written** more effectively. problem on one side of a flash card and the solution on the other  

> Handwriting builds stronger neural structures in memory than typing

**6. Take break**:  
**7. Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies**:  
- **Whenever** you are **struggling** with a concept, think to yourself, **How** can I **explain** this so that a **ten-year-old** could understand it?  
- **analogy** really helps, like saying that the flow of electricity is like the flow of water  
- Don’t just think your explanation—**say it out loud** or put it in writing.  

**8. Stay Focus**:  
- Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer  
- Try to set up times and places where studying  (25mins focus + 5mins' reward)  
- not glancing at your computer or phone  


**9. Eat your frogs first**:  
- Do the **hardest thing** **earliest** in the day, when you are fresh.

**10. Make a mental contrast**:  
- dream of **where** your studies will take you  
- post a **picture** or **words** in your workspace to **remind** you of **your** **dream**  
- This work **will pay off** both for **you** and **those you love**!

## Lesson 1: Diffuse vs Focused Mode


### Diffuse Mode vs. Focused Mode

**Diffuse Mode:**  
- while learning some new thing  
- try to connect the 'new' knowledge with previous experience/knowledge.  
- analogy: a pin ball table with wider spaced bumpers (boarder range of thinking).  

**Focused Mode:**  
- able to react fast with previous experience/skills.  
- because you are able to locate the location of the expereince/knowledge in your brain.  
- analogy: a pinball table with **more tight spacing** for rubber bumpers.(help keep your thought **concentrated**)  


Switching between Diffuse Modue and Focused Mode -> best for learning new knowledge. -> learning something difficult can take time -> one step at a time.


### Benefit of sleep

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160612neuron.png)

Neurons 神经元  
Synapses 神经元突触(connection between neurons)  
dendritic 树枝状的;  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160612sleep-neuron.png)

- sleeping help to create new neurons  
- which help to make more/better connections inside your brain.    
- Sleep make it easy to learn new things and solve problem.  
 


## Lesson 2: Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep




### Procrastination

- why ariase
- how to address it

Unhappy feeling  


Try to find something else more pleasant taks  


Feel Happy:) Temperory



### techinique to address it

![Pomodoro](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160612tomato.png)

Pomodoro technique - tomato shape 
- 25 minutes
- no interrution
- focus!!!
- reward!!!


### Practice Makes Permanent

>Why math and science is more diffcult?  
- maybe because of the abstract notation  
- no anology sign for you to relate in life (more abstract +-*/)  


![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160612practice-make-stronger.png)

Practice   
-> enhance/strengthen the neuron connection in your brain during the learning process.     
-> practtice make neuron connection from lighter -> darker(study hard -> take a break).  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160612little-every-day.png)

-> learn a little every day.(instead of cranking everything at once)  



### Intro to Memory

**Two major memory system:**  

Working memory (uncleared blackboard)  
- prefrontal cortex (front of your brain)  
- hold four slots/chunks of information  
- need **repetition** to enhance  
- insufficient black board that is blurred.
- while learn new things

Long term memory (storage ware-house) 
- it seperate all around a large area in different location, like ware-house.  
- different type of long-term memory stored in diferent locations of the brain.  
- large room as you practice and repeat.

#### Space reputation technique

Working memory -> *Space repetition technique* -> long term memory

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160612space-repetition.png)

> Space repetition technique:
> repeating a vocabuary 20 times a day does not give you a good result. Instead, try to space out the task in a consecutive/learn a little every day maner, you will find it less stressful to remember something. 



### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

- sleep **wash out** metabolic toxins out.  
- sleep **disconnet** neurons which is less important idea.  
- sleep also help to **strengthen** the connection of those neurons that connected important idea/concepts you want to remember.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160612dream.png)

> dreaming of what you are studying can substainal enhance the ablility to understand.


### Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

How to learn new thing?  
- learning by doing  
- learn from experts  


Boring lecture?   
- asking question  
- learning more by active engaging.  

How to get into diffused mode of thinking?   
- jogging for him  
- showering for me~  
- IMPORTANT -> remember that idea in difussed mode.


Multi-taksing?  
- wont survive without multi-taksing  
- two things at once -> not efficent  
- context swithing -> better -> hard to master -> back and forward  


Help to build better neurons connections and create more new neurons  
- Communciton/social -> running around
- exercise/sport  


Techniques help to learn/create more efectively?   
- being in a **creative environment**  
- good idea pop out while you are talking to other/explaining idea to others.   
- that is why we said teaching is one of the best way to learn better.   
- suceess not come by being smart  

```
success = panssionate + persistence
```

Testing skill?  
- aviod -> dont get hang out on one question  


## Lesson 3: Summary

Not possible in both focused and diffuse modes of thinking at the same time

> As far as neuroscientists know, you can't be in both focused and diffuse modes of thinking at the same time. It's like a coin (notice the analogy). You can see either one side or the other, but not both sides at the same time. Being in one mode of thinking seems to limit access to the other mode.

### Focused Mode vs. Diffuse Mode



**Focus Mode:**   

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160616/focused.png)  
- analogy: a pinball table with **more tight spacing** for rubber bumpers.(help keep your thought **concentrated**)  
- when you try to recall some thing you learned/ past experience.  
- stepping on a familiar path way of the focused mode.    
- the pin ball will more restrict to certain location of your brain.  
- happen MORE in the prefrontal cortex of brain.  



**Diffuse Mode:**   
![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160616/diffuse.png)  
- analogy: a pin ball table with wider spaced bumpers (boarder range of thinking).  
- the mode you use when you try to learn something new.  
- a mode with board ranging perspective.  
- represent the brain's many neural resting states.   
- the pin ball will bouncing around the brain and try to explore and relate/connect previous knowledge. 


**Access to diffuse mode:**   
walk, shower, sleep, go for a run, etc. 


**Learning something hard?**  
when learned something very hard: settle back little bit, and take a bit more time. That way, more neural processing can take place. 

> **Neural Processing:**  
> it always take time for neural processing to build up. Other wise, the structure build up will easily fall apart (Thing learn lightly easily forget)

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

**Procrastination:**  
- cause: some matter in brain that make you dislike the thing you currently need to accomplish.   
- analysis: this kind of dislike matter will gradually disappear once you start doing it.   
- possible soluiton: Pomodoro technique.(25mins stretch focus -> reward & 5-min reward part should not be skipped)  

**Memory:**  
- two types of memory system: Working memory & long term memory.  

**Working memory**  
- analogy: a blurred blackboard  
- Total four slots in working memory  
- things fall out of those slot unless we repeat to keep and hold them in mind     
- need to repeat to prevent loss of what you learn.  
- usully during focus mode  
- active in the prefrontal cortex area of your brain.  

**Long-term memory**
- analogy: storage wearhouse
- everywhere in your brain.  

Working memory -> Spaced Routine repeatition -> long term memory  


**Sleep:**   
- sleep helps to clean off toxin metabolic out of your brain.  
- sleep helps to recreate neurons and make more connections with other neurons.  
- sleep helps to solve hard problem by allowing brain switching from focus mode to diffuse mode.  
- if you think something hard before sleep, you will more likly be dreaming what you have learned.   


**Exercise/Sport** helps to improve both our memory and ability to learn.   


## Bouns Interviews: 

### Interview with Dr. Robert Bilder on Creativity and Problem Solving


Nature of change : always invovole discomfort  
> no pain, no gain	

**Five factors to determin characters:**   
- OCEAN  
- O -> openness  *  
- C -> conscientiousness  
- E -> extraversion,   
- A -> agreeableness *-> do not believe thing that is that what like people said. out side the box.  
- N -> neuroticisim  


> Star(*) indicate creative.

  
**Defination of Creatiative:**  
- new -> to you, or the world  
- useful -> 


**How to learn most effectively?**  
- words vs image vs voice  
- power of ten exercise (enhance creatiative)  
- zoom in and out from a problem.  


###  Interview with Writing Coach Daphne Gray-Grant

Writter:   

**how to write good and faster?**    
- diffuse mode -> writing (creative mode): make new connection, NO outline).  
- focused mode -> editing: grammar, spelling.  


**Mindmapping:**   
- just few words.  
- not need to 100% right  
- inspire yourself to write  


>no editing while you are writing. 


**first day of school.**

### Interview with "Benny the Irish Polyglot" about Learning Languages

Book Recon:   
[fluent in 3 months - benny lewis](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Months-Anyone-Language-Anywhere/dp/0062282697/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1465830489&sr=8-1&keywords=fluent+in+3+months+-+benny+lewis)

**GOOD reason to learn new language:**  
- passion for that language, culture.    
- willing to make mistake, people are more nicer than you think.  
- speak/pracitice with real person  
- change techniques while you are stuck in some points in the middle.  
- 6 pomorodo in a week, one day off. four weeks of pomorodo -> 2 days off. 

**Good way to remember:**

# Week2 due on 06/19/2016

## Lesson1: Chunking-The Essentials

### Introcution to Chunking

Chunks -> form chunks -> how chunk help you do better. 

Illusions -> 

Overlearning -> learn too much but not learning well
Interleaving -> more intellegent way to study

### What is a Chunk? 
**Chunk**: 
- chunk is like a group of ideas/relation to a certain concept/area/topic.  
- chunking is a way to **unite** **information** together **through meaning**.  


Once you form the **basic** chunks in your brain, the next step you are able to perform is to learn **advanced** techniques through connecting those basic chunks(techniques) together.  

> It will not work well to learn advanced techniques if you **do not** have a strong basic chunks.  

Logical learning -> 
Purely remembering: not understand or contest is not good -> 

Working memory: four slots. prefrontal contex
focused mode of learning -> creating chunk
if stressed/afraid/angry -> attentional octopus begins to lose ability to make connection -> brain not work properly.


**Learning a new language**
focused mode -> creating basic chunk by incorporate structured practice that includes repetition.

difussed mode -> free speach with native speaker
Create concepture chunk. 

> Chunking is the process of relate and connect newly learned ideas with previous learned knowledge togheter through understanding. 

**first step towards success in academic topics**

Create conceptual chunks, mental leaps, that **unite** scattered bits of **information** through **meaning**. 



### How to make a chunk? - part1

how to make a chunk?  
neural mini chunk -> largeer neural chunk -> larger complex chunk (instant react) -> best chunk(dont even need to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together) 

> what is missing from your way of learning through worked-out example? 

**Math problem example procedure:**   
1. heavy cognitive load ->   
2. start out with a work throguh example(listening to a song before trying to play the song yourself) ->  
3. see **key features** & **underline principles** of problem  

**One concern for this approach:**  
Worked out examplpes in math and science tend to make you focus too much on:  

	**why** an individual steps work

but forget to:  

	make [connection] of each individual steps


Therefore, the last step:  
4. making **connection** for individual steps become essential. (understand **why** this particular **step** is the **next thing** you should do) 

### How to make a chunk? - part 2

Basic steps are different in different disciplines.  

Focus on mental chunk forming.

#### 1.Focus:  
Focus on what you need to form the chunking the new material. (making new neural patterns and connecting them with preexising pattern with many area of previous learned)

#### 2.Understand:   
Understand the basic idea. (through switching between **focused mode** & **diffuse mode**)

> Can you create a chunk if you dont understand it?    
> 
> Yes!! Of course! But it is often a useless chunk that cannot fit-in or relate to other material of your learning.(Just like crunking a chunk for final before the night -> useless...)

**Understand the matieral:**  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160616/understand1.png)  
This is why you can grasp an idea **easily** when teacher presents it in class, 

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160616/understand2.png)  
but **if you don't review** it. fairly soon after you first learned it, 

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160616/understand3.png)  
it can seem **incomprehensible** when it comes time to prepare for a test. 

**For math and science problem:**   
Close the book,   
test yourself if you can solve the problem you think you understand.  

Looking through it, understand it, that is not enough.  
Only doing it yourself helps to create the neural pattern that underline true mastery.    


#### 3.Gaining context (practicing):  
**Defination**: context means going **beyond** the intial problem and seeing. (understand -> then try to see if this can also apply to other areas of studys)  
**Purpose**: See not just how, but also when to use this chunk.(similiar to many techniques to solve the same problem, but some method has its benefit under certain conditions. when to use it, when not to use it.)

> If you have many **tools/strategy(skills)** in your tool box, but if you dont **know** when to use that tool, it is not going to do you a lot of good. 


#### Top down and bottom up learning model

Learning take place in two ways:  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160616/top-down-learning.png)  

Buttom up Learning: 
- a chunking process  
- helps you to build up neural connections  
- through **practice** and **repetition**  

Top down Learning: 
- allows you to see what you're learning  
- and where it fits in.  

> context is where bottom up and top down learning meet.

Chunking: involve learning **how** to use a certain problem-solving technique.   
Context: means learning **when** to use that technique instead of some other techniques.  

> Both bottom-up and top-down processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material.  

#### Summary:   
1. focused attention  
2. understanding  
3. practice  


### Illusions of Competence

- recall  
- illusion of competence  
- mini-testing  
- value of making mistakes  

#### Recall
> when you forget something you learn yesterday from book, what will you do?  

You can either go back to the same location of the book and perform the **passive re-reading**. However, a much more effective way of learning deeper into the materail is through **repeated recalled** of what you just have learned.   

This technique also helps us to begin forming chunks. 

#### illusion of competence  
**Definition**: you think you master the concept by simplely glimps the solution manual. 

By having the textbook/google in front of them, they have the **illusion** that the material is also in their brains. Because it is much more **easier** to look up from the book comparing to recall, students persist in their **illsuions** studying in a way that just isn't very effective.    

Good idoms!!!
> Just wanting to learn the material and spending a **lot of time** with it, does **not** **guarantee** you will **actually** **learn** it. Test yourself on what you are learning!!

- do well in test.  
- think creatively with it.  
- careful with high-lighting (uncareful hightlighting will sometimes be more confusing).  
- one sentence or less / paragraph.  


#### mini-testing  
NA

#### value of making mistakes 
- **embrace** every mistakes you made  
- not try to repeat your mistakes, of course.  
- allow you to **make repairs** in your thinking flow bit by bit.  
- helps you to correct your thinking, so you can learn better and do better.  


> Recall is important to enhance and grasp the material you try to master it. Recalling material at a location that is **outside your usual place** of study can also help you. Practice recalling material in different location will help you to have a much better chance of retriving the useful information especially in a stressful exam environment.  

## Lesson2: Seeing the Bigger Picture

### What Motivates You? 
 - acetylcholine 
 - dopamine  
 - serotonin  

#### Acetylcholine 
 - a chemical produced by some neurons.  
 - affects focused learning and attention.  

#### Dopamine (Satisfication)
- a chemical substance that controls motivation  
- Dopamine neurons part of large brain system that control reward learning.  
- released when receive an unexpected **immediated** reward.  
- can also predict **future** rewards    
- ex. addictive drug fool your brain in this way by increasing dopamine activity to let you think wonderful thing will happen.(which will be oppsite than that, lead to dependence, hijack your free will)  

#### Serotonin molecule
- strongly affect your **social activity**  
- link to **risk taking** behavior  
- higher serotonin activity -> more social  
- lower serotonin activity -> higher risk  

> Emotions is strongly linked to **cognition/perception** and interact with **learning and memory**.  

You will want to keep your **amygdala** happy to be an effective learner.  



### The Value of a Library of Chunks
- graudally build the number of chunks in their mind.  
- to enhance knowledge and gain expertise.  
- bigger and more well practiced chunked mental library  
- relate chunks in different fiedls (Transfer). 

> Transfer: relate technique you learned in a subject and you use that to help solving problem in another subject.  

#### Filling in chunks
![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160620/fill-chunk.png)

- as you build in each chunk, it is filling in a part of your larger knowledge picture.

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160620/faint.png)
  
- the chunk will **faint and disapper** without practicing.  
- harder to put together the big picture of what you are trying to learn.  



#### Two ways to figure something out/solve problem

**Sequential Thinking**  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160620/sequencial.png)
- step by step reasoning  
- involved focused mode  

**Holistic(Global) Intuition**  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160620/holistic.png)
- creative diffuse mode  
- somehow invovle intuition  
- make **leap** away from what are usually familiar with  
- involve "Global" knowledge (chunks/knowledge that seems not related)  
- linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts   
- intuition inside usually is not correct, further/deeper analysis with focused mode is required.  


> feeling of a lot to learn in a signle chapter?? Let Law of Serendipity to help you.  

#### Law of Serendipity
- Lady Luck **favors** the one who **tries**  
- Just focus on whatever section you are studying  
- Once you put the **first** problem/concept into your mental library  
- The **second** will goes in little more easily  
- The **third** more easiliy still   
- Believe me: It always get easier once you get started :)  

 
### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

#### Overlearning 
- sometimes valuable for public speaking  
- repetitive something that you know perfectly well is somehow wasteful of time  
- delibrately focus on what you think is difficult  

#### Deliberate Practice
- focus and practice on thing that you feel difficult  
- make difference between a **good student** and a **great student**  

#### Einstellung
- a familiar neural pattern that prevent you come up with a better solution. (confortable zone)  
- Einstellung = mindset  
- Intuition sometimes misleading  
- You might need to un-learn your older idea while you are learning a new one  


#### Interleaving
- once understand basic techinque  
- try different types of approach/procedures  
- sometimes harder/tough to do, but try to mix up learning  
- doing problem that on different chapters out-of order seems harder, but will help you learn more deeply in reality  
- **Interleaving** is as important as **practice and repetition**   
- interleaving create creativity  
- learning one displine in a deep maner will find it even **harder** to branch out from your familiar way of thinking and find it **harder** to handle new ideas. 

> Repetition builds **solid neural patterns** to draw on. Interleaving builds **flexiblity and creativity** 
 

### Summary


- **Chunks** are information that bound togther through **use** and **meaning**. 
- get bigger and more complex  
- chunks are best built with 1. focused attention, 2. understanding idea, and 3. Practice(provide you a sense of big-picture)  
- **Recall** without looking at the page help to build stronger chunks 
- **Recall** material in place that is **different from place** where you learned it  
- **Transfer** is the idea of chunk you mastered in one area can often help you understand concept/problem in other area  
- **Interleave** your learning with different concepts/approaches/techniques all in one session builds **flexibiliy** to your expertise.  
- **Illusions of competence in learning** - test yourself using mini-testing/recall  
- **Minimize** **highlighting** to help to your brain better **understanding** the material and making logical connection  
-  Mistakes are **good** - allow you to catch illsuion of competence  
-  Use **deliberate practice** - difficult material are always the things you dont want to miss to gain full mastery of the material   
-  **Einstellung** - idea of familiar idea/ way of thinking **prevent** you come up with **better idea/solution**  
-  **Law of Serendipity** - Lady Luck favors the one who tries, one tiny thing to learn, then the other (one step at a time)  

## Lesson3: Interview

### Amy Alkon

**How to use diffuse mode to help writing and learning**:   
- take **break**  
- work everyday - **little by little**  
- So as she washing dishes, it give her time to rethink and information has time to processing  
- doing it days **ahead of time** that really made a difference  

**Help to prevent Procrastination?**
- turn on a **timmer**  
- she like an hour -> give her more time into a flow state  
- put in that time  


**Fast pace reading, tip to remember key points in book**
- approch book as a buffet  
- **skip** the part that you read/know  
- read the thing you **never** read before  
- remember key points: **write it down** with pen and **tape it outside your wall** when she is showering(better thinking during shower with diffuse mode)  

**How to learn most efficiently?**   
- read **few more times** even it was not making sense in the begining  
- go to other reference material

# Week4 due on 07/03/2016

## Lesson 1 : Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential I

### How to Become a Better Learner
**Two tips** to learn better: 

**Physical Exercise**:  
- more effect than any drugs in the market to help you learn better.  
- Exercise helps to generate new neurons around the **Hippocampus**, which is an important area for human to learn new things.  
- **New neurons** (newly learn material) **will die** (forget) if you dont use it.  

**Practice and Learn new idea**:  
- practice can repair and train the brain  
- but it may take longer  
- **Learning**, planing, language make us human  
- Two experiences that help your neurons to grow and survive are **exercise** and exposure to **new environments or ideas**.



### Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential
- enhance your learning by **creating** **metaphor** and **analogy**  
- work profitably with **teammates**

#### Q&A section

**Answer:** 

I usually always think the longer time you take, the better scores you will get in the exam. And the hardly facts tell me that is not the case. As I spent lots of time to seat in from of desk while other still having fun outside usually has higher score then me. I realized that I was actually seating there most of the time but not actually `learning`. One of the thing I would like to improve on is to recall material I just learn, organize and speak it out will easily help you to spot out the missing points. Also, as the video discussed, learning from one teacher and one textbook is usually only a smaller portion of what you are trying to learn. Use your own thinking and learning further by yourself.

### The Value of Teamwork

#### Difference between two hemispheres of the brain  
**Right hemisphere:**   
- big picture perspective  
- people with right hemisphere damage are often unable to gain `ah-ha`, insights.  
- look for global **inconsistencies**  

**Left hemisphere:**   
- mode of analysis  
- potential for rigidity, **dogmastism** and **egocentricity**  
- **overly confident perspecitves** arising in left hemisphere   

> Rushing your homeowrk/quiz **without** going back to check the answer is acting like a person who is refusing to use parts of your brain. Maybe try to **take** a mental **breath**, and then **revisit** what you have done with **bigger picture** in mind to see whether it makes sense.  

Step back and recheck allows for more **interaction** between the hemispheres.  

> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool - Richard Feynman"

Friends and teams serve as questioning **larger scale** diffuse mode outside your brain that can catch what you missed, or what you just can't see.

1. **go through** and **get a sense** of what is in the exam  
2. We should **start on the hard** one first to get a better sense of understanding, and then **when you get stuck**, just **swithch to an easy one**. Let you parts of the brain working on the other hard question while other parts working on the easy ones.
