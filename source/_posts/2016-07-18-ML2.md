# Week 4: Lesson 1
## <center>Motivations</center>
### Non-linear Hypotheses
- new learning algorithm: **neural network**  

#### Why **neural network**: new learning algorithm?  

- non-linear classification(logistic regress ex) works well with only **two features**  
- more interesting problems will invovle more than two features  
- Too many features (quadratic order -> $O(N^2)$, cubic order -> $O(N^3)$) will result in **overfitting**  
- Use **subset** of features will not provide best model to fit all the training set(underfit)  

#### Car identify example

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160707/car.png)

- $50 * 50$ picture = $2500$ pixels (in grayscale).  
- RGB -> $2500 * 3 = 7500$ pixels  
- the $x$ vector represent pixel intensity(0-255)  
- if we use non-linear hypothesis with quadratic features $(x_i \times x_j)$, 3 millions features (computational expensive!)  
- simple **logicstic regression** with quadratic/cubic features **not** a good way to learn complex non-linear hypothesis when number of n(feature) is large.   


### Neurons and the Brain
- neural networks are old algorithm  
- background in neural networks  
- how to apply them into problem  


#### Neural Networks  
- Origins: Algorithms that try to mimic the brain.  
- Was widely used in 80s, and diminished in late 90s.(lack of computational power)  
- Recent resurgence: state-of-art technique for many applicaitons  

> **Auditory Cortex**: part of your brain that allows you to lean to hear.  

> **Somatosensory Cortex**: part of your brain that allows you to process sense of touch.

### Model Representation I  
- how to represent hypothesis and model with neural network  

#### Simulation of neuron in the brain  
![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160707/neuron.png)

#### Computation steps of neural netwrok

**Notations**:   
$a_i^{(j)} = $ "activation" of unit $i$ in layer $j$.  
$\theta^{(j)} = $ matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer $j$ to layer $j+1$.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160707/neural-network-example.png)

**Mathmatical representation:**

### Multiclass Classification
- **more than one categories** we tried to distinguish  
- ex. handwritten digits recognization problem

#### Exercise

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160707/exercise2.png)

$$s_{j+1} \times (s_j +1)$$. 

Solution: sAccodring to equation above: $S_{j+1} = 10 $, and $S_j = 5$, therefore, $\theta^{(2)} = 10 \times 6 = 60 $.  


# Week 5: Lesson 1
## <center>Cost Function and Backpropagation</center>
### Cost Function
- fiting the parameter of the neural network  
- backward propagtion? 

#### Neural Network(Classification)  
$L$ = total no. of layers in network  
$S_l$ = number of units in layer `l`   
$K$ = number of units in the output layer (K classes).   


#### Cost Function for Logisitc regression:

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160715/logisitc-regression-regularization.png)

#### Cost Function for Neural network:

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160715/cost-function-neural-network.png)

> the bias terms $\theta_{10}, \theta_{20} ... $ are NOT regularized

- similar to logistic regression, we sum over all the values for `y` : ($1\times k$ **vector**) to find a minimum cost value.  
- similar to the logstic regression, we also sum over all the $\theta$ values in the **matrics** $θ$ $(m \times n)$ matrics.  
- the change (smaller $\theta$) of $\theta$ values in the regularzation term help to prevent **overfitting**.  
- the change of $\theta$ values will also affect the hypothesis function $h_\theta(x)$, which will also directly affect the cost function $J(\theta)$.  
- the regularzation term, elegantly contorl $\theta$ values to 1. **prevent**  overfitting of the hypothesis function, as well as 2.**minimize** the cost function. 

### Backpropagation Algorithm
- cost function for neural network $J_\theta$  
- find the most **optimal theta values** with backpropagation algorithm.  

#### Gradient Computation
To find the optimal theta values, With the advanced optimzation algorithm, we just **need code** for following:   

1. $J(\theta)$  
2. $\frac{\partial}{\partialΘ^{(l)_{ij}}}J(Θ)$  

We already have the equation for $J(\theta)$, we will focus on how to find the partial derivative for second equation.  

#### step 1 : compute Forward Propagation
we need to perform forward propagation to find $a^{(1)},a^{(2)}...$.  

Simple example with only **one training** example.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160715/forward.png)

#### step 2: compute Backward Propagation

$\delta_j^{(l)}$ = "error" of cost for activation unit $a_j^{(l)}$ node $j$ in layer $l$. (where l = 2...L).  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160715/backprop.png)

For each **output layer**: ($L = 4$ e.x. four layers neural network)  

$$\delta_j^{(4)} = a_j^{(4)} - y_j$$

find error for each element j in the column vector $a$(activtion unit) and $y$(result of hypothesis function)

Vetorized form for equation above: 

$$\delta^{(4)} = a^{(4)} - y$$


![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160715/step.png)

> Note: there is **NO** $\delta^{(1)}$ term for backpropgation. 


#### Backprogation Algorithm for multiple training data

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160715/bprop-multiple-traning-set.png)

Need to loop through all the $l$ ? 

> For error $\delta$ and activation unit $alpha$, we need to loop through $l = 2...L$.  
> For $\Delta$, in a three-layers neural network, $\Delta^1$ and $\Delta^2$ have same dimension as `Theta1` and `Theta2`. 

### Backprogation Intuition

# Week 5: Lesson 2
## <center>Backpropagation in Practice</center>
### Implementation Note: Unrolling Parameters
- previously, we went over how to use backpropgation to find the derivative of cost function.  
- this video focus on **unrolling** parameters.   

#### Unroll into vectors
- $Θ$ and $D$ are all matrics, we want to unroll them into **vector** to fit the cost function for advanced optimization.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/advanced-optimization.png)
  
Both `theat` and `gradient` are $n\times 1$ vector.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/unroll-neural-network.png)

we want to unroll matrices $Θ$ and $D$ to **vector** so that we can use as input for the cost function, and stay consistent with the same dimension with output gradient as well.  

#### Example: 

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/unroll-example.png)

```matlab

% unroll to vector

thetaVec = [ Theta1(:); Theta2(:); Theta3(:)];
DVec = [D1(:), D2(:); D3(:)];

% recover back to matrics

Theta1 = reshape(thetaVec(1:110), 10, 11); % take first 1-110 elemnts, recover back to 10x11 matrics
Theta2 = reshape(thetaVec(111:220), 10, 11); 
Theta3 = reshape(thetaVec(221:231), 1, 11);

```

Batter intutation of the unroll function in matlab:  


```matlab
>> a = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]

a =

     1     2
     3     4
     5     6

>> a(:)

% unroll into column vector by column

ans =

     1
     3
     5
     2
     4
     6
     
```

Reshape function in matlab:  

```matlab

>> a

a =

     1     2
     3     4
     5     6

>> b

b =

     1     1     1
     1     1     1

>> c = [a(:); b(:)]

c =

     1
     3
     5
     2
     4
     6
     1
     1
     1
     1
     1
     1

>> recoverA = reshape(c(1:6),3,2)

recoverA =

     1     2
     3     4
     5     6

```

#### Advanced optimzation algorithm (neural network)  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/advanced-optimzation-neural-network.png)  

- inside the cost fucntion, we recover all vectors back to matrics to maximize the **vectorized** computation for forward and backward propagation.  
- while outside the cost function, we unroll it back to vectors for input and output since the advanced optimzation algorithm assume input and output are in long vector form.  



### Gradient Checking
- backpropagation is error prompting  
- has bug even cost function is decreasing  
- subtle bug can be catched by **gradient checking**  

> Gradient = is the derivative of the cost function $J(\theta)$

#### Numerical estimation of gradients

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/gradient-approximation-check.png)

> Note:  $\epsilon = 10^{(-4)}$ is a common use value for $\epsilon$

#### Parameter vector - partial derivative of Cost function

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/vector-theta.png)  

**Code for Acutal implementation:**

```matlab

for i = 1:n,
	thetaPlus = theta;
	thetaPlus(i) = thetaPlus(i) + EPSILON;
	thetaMinus = theta;
	thetaMinus(i) = thetaMinus(i) - EPSILON;
	gradApprox(i) = (J(thetaPlus) - J(thetaMinus)) / (2*EPSILO);
end;

```
Finally we check that `gradApprox ~= DVec`, where `DVec` calculated from backpropagation.  

#### Implementation note: 

Once you finish gradient checking for back-propagation, **TURN OFF** the numerical gradient checking, since gradient checking is a very heavy computation.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/implementation-note.png)

### Random Initialization
- how to pick initial theta value for advanced optimzation.  

setting initial theta values to zeros, `initialTheta = zeros(n,1)` works for gradient descent, however, it does not work for neural network.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/zero-initalization-neural-network.png)

Zero initialization for neural network, after each update, parameters corresponding to inputs going into each of two **hidden units are identical**.  

#### Random Initalizaiton alogrithm: Symmetry breaking  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/random-initialization.png)

?? Symmetry breaking ?? 


### Putting It Together

#### Step 1: Pick a network architecture 
- number of input units:Dimension of features $x^{(i)}  
- number of output units:Number of classes  
- number of hidden layers: default one layer.(even more hidden layers, better)  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/hidden-layer-choice.png)  

#### Step 2: Randomly initialze weights: small values near zeros

#### Step 3: Implement forward propgation to get $h_Θ(x^{(i)})$ for any $x^{(i)}$

#### Step 4: Implement code to compute cost function $J(Θ)$

#### Step 5: Implement backprop to compute partial derivatives $\frac{\partial}{\partial{θ}_{jk}^{(l)}} J(Θ)$

?? why perform regularization when doing back-prop??

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/for-back-prop-exampe.png)

#### Step 6: Numerical Gradient checking
- disable gradient checking code after checking  


#### Step 7: Gradient descent/Advanced Optimzation with backpropagation to try to minimize $J(Θ)$. 
$J(Θ)$ - not convex -> only local optimal, NOT global global optimal.  
However, in practice, the local optimal solution by backprop usually works pretty well.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160716/graphical-idea-backprop.png)

back-prop calculate the **direction** of going down hill, gradient descent is taking the **actual step** down hill.

## <center>Application of Neural Networks</center>
### Autonomous Driving



# Week 5: Programnig Assignemnt Tips

Follow steps below to better implement the programing assigment with **vectorized** implementation for back-propagation.  


```
Let:

m = the number of training examples

n = the number of training features, including the initial bias unit.

h = the number of units in the hidden layer - NOT including the bias unit

r = the number of output classifications

-------------------------------

1: Perform forward propagation, see the separate tutorial if necessary.

2: δ3 or d3 is the difference between a3 and the y_matrix. The dimensions are the same as both, (m x r).

3: z2 came from the forward propagation process - it's the product of a1 and Theta1, prior to applying the sigmoid() function. Dimensions are (m x n) ⋅ (n x h) --> (m x h)

4: δ2 or d2 is tricky. It uses the (:,2:end) columns of Theta2. d2 is the product of d3 and Theta2(no bias), then element-wise scaled by sigmoid gradient of z2. The size is (m x r) ⋅ (r x h) --> (m x h). The size is the same as z2, as must be.

5: Δ1 or Delta1 is the product of d2 and a1. The size is (h x m) ⋅ (m x n) --> (h x n)

6: Δ2 or Delta2 is the product of d3 and a2. The size is (r x m) ⋅ (m x [h+1]) --> (r x [h+1])

7: Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad are the same size as their respective Deltas, just scaled by 1/m.

Now you have the unregularized gradients. Check your results using ex4.m, and submit this portion to the grader.

===== Regularization of the gradient ===========

Since Theta1 and Theta2 are local copies, and we've already computed our hypothesis value during forward-propagation, we're free to modify them to make the gradient regularization easy to compute.

8: So, set the first column of Theta1 and Theta2 to all-zeros. Here's a method you can try in your workspace console:


1
2
Q = rand(3,4)       % create a test matrix
Q(:,1) = 0          % set the 1st column of all rows to 0
9: Scale each Theta matrix by λ/m. Use enough parenthesis so the operation is correct.

10: Add each of these modified-and-scaled Theta matrices to the un-regularized Theta gradients that you computed earlier.

You're done. Use the test case (linked below) to test your code, and the ex4 script, then run the submit script.

```

# Week 6: Lesson 1

## Evaluating a Learning Algorithm  

### <center> Deciding What to Try Next </center>
- practical issue while implementing your learning algorithm  
- Potential things you can try to make it better  
- Diagnostics - a techical way to help you to analyize and help you effectly select on **specific** **things** to try and **improve** for your learning algorithm    


#### Problem in real practice:  
Lets say you test your hypothesis on a new set of houses with regularized linear regression.  
  
{% raw %}$$J(\theta) =  \frac 1 {2m}[\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n}\theta_j^2] $${% endraw %}  

 
> What if you find that it makes unacceptably large errors in its predictions, what could you try next?  
  
- get **more** training examples (not work well as always)  
- **smaller** sets of features(prevent overfitting)  
- Try getting **additional** features  
- Try adding **polynomial** features  
- Try **increasing/decreasing** $\lambda$, regularization parameter  

However, which one above to choose to try? Randomly will waste your time after 6 months of your effort.  

#### Machine learning diagnostic: 
- a test on what is **NOT** working in the current learning algorithm  
- provides guidence to imporve its performance  
- Diagnostics **can take time** to implement, **but** doing so can be **worth** use of your time.

### <center> Evaluating a Hypothesis </center>
- how to evalulate a hypothesis learned by your algorithm  
- how to prevent overfiitng/underfitting  
- evalulate a hypothesis : plotting  
- evalulate a hypothesis : Spliting data set into training(70%) and testing(30%) set.  
- know how to compute **test-set-error** and **Misclassification error**.   


#### Evaluating your hypothesis (Ploting)  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/evaluate-training-set-polting.png)  

plotting hypothesis works well for small number of features, however it is impossible to plot for lots of features.  

#### Evaluating your hypothesis (Spliting your data set)

- 70% for training set  
- 30% for test set  
- **randomly sort** the datasets before data spliting  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/evaluate-split-data.png)  

**Training/testing procedure**  
- learning parameter $\theta$ from **traning data**.  
- compute **test set error**. (average-square-error, same equation to compute the cost function, we use test-set instead of training set)  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/test-set-error-compute.png)  

For **logistic regression**, beside computing **test set error**, we can also try to compute **misclassification error**( a.k.a. 0/1 misclassification error)  

#### Misclassification error (a.k.a. 0/1 misclassification error)  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/misclassification-error.png)  



### <center>Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets</center>
- decide degree of polynomical  
- what feature to include for the learning algoirthm   
- model selection problem  
- split data set into: train(60%), validation(20%), and test set(20%).  


#### Overfitting problem
- hypothesis function perfectly fit training data does not mean it will predicting the un-seen data well (not able to generalization)  

#### Model selection
- degree of polynomial (d ) 
- linear, qudratic, cubic function  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/model-selection.png)  

#### Evaluating your hypothesis
- we split data sets into **three** sections to better helping to select the best model.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/split-three-section.png)

- training set (60%)  
- cross validation set - CV(20%)  
- test set (20%)  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/three-part-model-selection.png)  

Now, we are able to use **training set** to find $Θ$ for each polynomial degree, we then use **cross validation set** to select the lowest {% raw %} $J_{cv}$ {% endraw %} cost. We finally use **test set** to estimate generalization error as {% raw %}$J_{test}$.{% endraw %} 

# Week 6: Lesson 2

## Bias vs. Variance

### <center> Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance </center>

- identify underfiting/overfiting  
- evaluate problem of bias/variance issues  
- **bias**: high {% raw %} $J_{train}(\theta)$ and $ J_{cv}(\theta)$  {% endraw %}
- **variance**: {% raw %}low $J_{train}(\theta)$ high $ J_{cv}(\theta)$ {% endraw %}

#### Bias/Variance  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/bias-variance.png)

Bias - underfit  
variance - overfit  

#### Diagnosing bias vs. variance  

Suppose your learning algorithm is not as well as you have perdict, how can we know if it is a bias problem or a variance problem?  

First, we need to plot{% raw %}
 $J_{cv}(\theta)$ {% endraw %} (cross-validation error) and {% raw %}$J_{train} (\theta)$ {% endraw %}(training error) in a error vs degree of polynomial d.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/error-degree-polynomial.png)  
 
**Bias(underfit):**  
- **both** {% raw %} $J_{train}(\theta)$ and $J_{cv}(\theta)$ {% endraw %} will be **high**  
- {% raw %} $J_{train}(\theta) \approx J_{cv}(\theta)$  {% endraw %}

**Variance(overfit):**  
- $J_{train}(\theta)$ will be **low**.  
- {% raw %} $J_{train}(\theta) \gg J_{cv}(\theta)$ {% endraw %}

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160718/high-varience-bias.png)

### <center> Regularization and Bias/Variance </center>
- how regularization affect bias and variance  
- how to automatically find $\lambda$ value: the regularzation parameter  
- recall the procedures in utilizing $J_{cv}(\theta)$ to pick the most optimized $\lambda$ value.  


#### Linear Regression with Regularization  

$\lambda$ = is the regularization parameter. A large value of $\lambda$ will heavily penalize all the $\theta$ values, which result in high bias(underfit). On the other hand, a too small $\lambda$ value will result in small effect by the regularization terms, which will result in high varience (overfit).

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160719/lambda-vs-cost-function.png)  

> **Note**:  
> {%raw%} We first use $J_{(\theta)}$ with the regularzaiton term to find the $minJ(\theta)$ which will give us the most optimal $Θ$ values base on the setting of degree of polynomial and regularization value $\lambda$. Even though the calculation of $J_{train}(\theta)$ is not directly assoicate with the looking for the best $\lambda$ value for the regularization term. The best $\lambda$ value directly associate with where smallest value of $J_{cv}(\theta)$ appear. However, the calcuation of $J_{train}(\theta)$, and $J_{cv}(\theta)$ together will result in a nice graph above. {%endraw%}  
> With the present of graph above, we will be able to **graphically determine** whether bias/variance issues remain. 

### <center> Learning Curves </center>
- Learning Curves helps to diagnoise if a learning algorthm is suffering from bias/variance  
- A learning curves make up of {%raw%} $J_{train}(\theta)$ and $J_{cv}(\theta)$ {%endraw%}  
- Poltting the learning curve will usually tells you if the learning algorithm is suffering from bias or variance.  


#### Learning curves

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160719/learning-curve-def.png)

Lerning curve consisit of following:   
- $J_{train}(\theta)$ vs $m$  
- $J_{cv}(\theta)$ vs $m$   

where $m$ represents traning set size.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160719/high-bias.png)

If suffering from **high bias**, getting more training examples doesn't help much. (change of model/degree of polynomial)  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160719/high-variance.png)

If suffering from **high variance** problem, getting more traning examples is likely to help. ({%raw%} $J_{train}(\theta)$ is low, as more getting more data, $J_{cv}(\theta)$ is likely to approaching $J_{train}(\theta)$ {%endraw%})


### <center>Deciding What to Do Next Revisited</center>
- what we can do with what we have learned so far from week 6.  


#### Debugging a learning algorithm:
Previously, we talked about few things we could possible try to improve our learning algorithm when the the hypothesis function did not give us a accurate prediction for un-seen data points.  

Now we everything we learned above, we could easily nail down half the unrelated options base on our analysis.  

- get **more** training examples (fix high variance)  
- **smaller** sets of features (fix high variance)  
- Try getting **additional** features (fix high bias: function is too simple -> need more complex function to better fitting the hypothesis function)
- Try adding **polynomial** features (fix high bias) 
- Try **increasing** $\lambda$ (fix high variance)
- Try **decreasing** $\lambda$ (fix high bias)

#### Neural Network and Overfitting
- take what we learned and **relate** back to **neural netowrk**.  
- small neural network (underfitting) vs. large neural network(overfitting)  

**Small neural network:**  
- **fewer** parameters  
- more prone to **underfitting**  
- computationally cheaper  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160719/small-neural-network.png)

**Large neural network:**  
- large: either more activation units per layer or more layers.  
- **more** parameters  
- more prone to **overfitting** (solve by regularization term($\lambda$))  
- computationally more **expensive**.  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160719/large-neural-network.png)

 Larger network + regularzaiton($\lambda$) $\gg$ small neural network  

#### How to decide how many layers for hidden layer? 

We could use the similiar techniques we used to determine the best $\lambda$ value.  

We split the data into three different sections and use the cross-validation technique with 1-layer, 2-layer, 3-layer and choose the layer with minimum $J_{cv}(Θ)$.  

#### Exercise:  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160719/exercise.png)
{%raw%} $J_{cv}(Θ)$ $\gg$ $J_{train}(Θ)$ {%endraw%}, we know that the learning algorithm is suffering from high variance (overfitting). Because of that, increasing the number of hidden layer (increasing number of $\theta$ parameter) will possiblly not doing any benefit to the learning algorithm.  

I would suggest **decreasing** number of hidden layer units OR getting **more** training examples OR adding **regularization** terms to imporve the learning algorithm.  


# Week 6: Lesson 4

## Building a Spam Classifier

### <center> Prioritizing What to Work On </center>
- prioritize what you need to work on to save your time.  

#### Building a spam classifier
- how to determine the $x=$ feature of email.  

Maybe feature $x$: choose 100 words indicative of spam/not spam.  

`E.g: deal, buy, discount, andrew, now...`  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160721/spam-classifier.png)

> Note: in practice, take most frequently occurring $n$ words (10,00 to 50,000) in training set, rather than manually pick 100 words.  


#### Building a spam classifier
How to spend your time to make it have low error?  
- collect lots of data ("honeypot" project.)  
- better features based on email routing information (from **email header**)  
- better features for message body (deal, Dealers? features about punctuation)  
- Develope sophisticated algorithm to detect misspellings (ex. w4thches, mad1cine, m0rtgage.)  
 
### <center> Error Analysis </center>
- a way to make decision more **systematically**  
- **start** with **simple implementation** and start testing the result  
- perform **error analysis** on result data.  
- **numerical evaluation** to decide whether it is good or not about the changes you made to your algorithm  

#### Recommended approach
- start with a **simple algorithm** that you can implement quickly.  
- implement it and test on **cv data** set.  
- plot **learning curves** to decide if more data, more features, etc. are likely to help.  
- Error analyisis: **manually** spot **systemtically pattern** of mis-classifying email.  


#### Example of Error Analysis

$m_{cv}$ = 500 examples in cross validation set.  

Algorithm misclassifies 100 emails. 
Manually examine the 100 errors, and categorize them based on:  
(i) what **type** of email it is.  
(ii) what **cues (features)** you think would have helped the algorithm classify them correctly.  

In the 100 misclassified emails, we collected following types:  

```
Pharma: 12  
Replica/fake: 4  
Steal Password: 53  
Other: 31
```
In this case, we will possible put more efforts on spending more time in analyzing type of `steal password` email to improve the algorithm.  

#### The important of numerical evaluation

`Stemming`: (software: "Porter Stemmer")  

Idea of stemming: treating words with same `stem` with same meaning. (discount/discounts/discounted/discounting)  

Disadvantage: even same `stem`, however, the meaning of the words might be totally different. (universe/university)  

The performance of the use of `stemming` is unknown unless we run **numerical evaluation** (e.g. **cross validation error**) of algorithm's performance with and without stemming.  

```java
without stemming: 5% error

with stemming: 3% error.

stemming has better performance
```

# Week 6: Lesson 5

## Handling Skewed Data

### <center> Error Metrics for Skewed Classes </center>
- definition of **skew class**  
- **definition** of recall and percission  
- **equation** for recall and percission  
- how can we use recall and percission to detect 'cheating' classifier  


#### Skew class

**Definition**: the number of data sets is significant smaller than the data number of other class. The data sets with smaller number is called the **skewed class**.   

#### Precision/Recall

$y=1$ in presence of rare class that we want to detect.  


![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160721/precission-recall.png)

**Precision:**
Patient who **don't have** cancer, but you **predicted** they have cancer.  

$Percission = \frac{True Positive}{Predicted Positive} = \frac{TruePositive}{TruePos+FalsePos}$

**Recall:** 
Patient who **has** cancer, you **predicted** they **don't have** cancer.  

$Recall = \frac{TruePositive}{ActualPositives} = \frac{TruePositive}{TruePos+FalseNeg}$

A cheating classifer with always predicting `y=0`(always not cancer) or `y=1` (always cancer) will not have high recall and high percission **at the same time**.

A classifer with always predicting `y=1` all the time will have a **high** **recall** (recall = 1) -> lower percision.  

A classifer with always predicting `y=0` all the time will have a **high** **percision** (percision = 1) -> lower recall.


### <center>Trading Off Precision and Recall </center>
- how do we evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall?  
- how to use F-score to find the best trade-off between precision and recall parameter  
- automatically set threshold with F-score. 

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160721/percission-recall.png)

How to automatically pick the **threshold** above.  

**Single** matrix comparison is easy (pick the **max** or **min** of the parameter)

However, in precision and recall matrix, we have **two** variables (precission(P) & recall(R)). 

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160721/compare-percission-recall.png)

Potential solutions: 

#### Determine good recall/variance: Average: 

$$Average=\frac{P+R}{2}$$  

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160721/recall-percission-average.png)  

Not good, since algorithm 3: y=1 all the time has highest average. Not a good algorithm to evaluate the values of percision/recall numbers.  

#### Determine good recall/variance: F Score

$$F_{score} = 2 \frac{PR}{P+R}$$ 

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160721/F-SCORE.png)

#### automatcially determine the threshold for classifier: $h(x)$ function

try out few different thresholds and test on cv data set, and evaluate the highest F-score. 

### <center> Data For Machine Learning </center>
- Understanding of how large data set help improve learning algorithm.  
- What is the userful test for the assumption for the idea of large data win.  


> It's not who has the best algorithm that wins. It's who has the most data.  - Andrew Ng.  

All the idea about enhancing your learning algorithm with very large amount of data is based on the assumption below: 

**Assumption:**  

> Assume feature $x\in R^{n+1}$ has **sufficient** information to predict $y$ correctly

How can we determine whether or not the feature provide is **sufficient**?  

There is a simple test: Given the input $x$, can a human expert confidently predict $y$?  

#### Userful test

![](http://7xihzu.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/20160721/large-amout-data.png)

Given the sentence above, an expert in English speaking will be easily fill in the sentence with word 'two' (not 'to' or 'too') base on the information (features) given in the sentence.  

However, an counter example of given only the size of a house (without the location, age), even an estitate expert will not be able to predict a fair price (y) for the house.  

#### Improve performance with large data set

Having a large training set can significantly improve the learning algorithm with the **assumption** of "The features has enough information to predict y accurately" held on.  

Using a learning algorithm with **many parameters** will still be fine when we have a large set of training data. {%raw%}$J_{train}(\theta)$ {%endraw%} will be small. And since we are using a **very large** training set, it is **unlikely** to overfit. Therefore, {%raw%}$J_{train(\theta)} \approx J_{test}(\theta)$, which means $J_{test}(\theta)$ will likely be small.{%endraw%}
